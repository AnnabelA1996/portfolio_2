            <p class="paragraph_1">Hey, I’m Annabel Ambrosius…

                Before you ask, yes, my surname is like the dessert, the type of apple and the stuff Greek gods were
                drunk
                on 24/7 – Let’s get to the important stuff!
                <br>
                <br>
                I have always been a creative person and am lucky enough to be able to translate this strength into my
                career. Having studied a Bachelor of Fine Arts majoring in Graphic Design at the University of
                Canterbury
                and graduating in 2019, I learnt the ropes of everything design and more. I have since found myself
                designing web, packaging, products, marketing and social media collateral for wholesale products. As
                well as
                this I have tried my hand at creating branding and business cards for shiny new projects, business
                rebrands,
                and freelance photographers.
                <br>
                <br>
                More recently I have been challenging myself to further develop my skills in the web arena by completing
                a
                Web Training Package through Yoobee Colleges. Here I have focussed my skills on web development and
                learning
                coding languages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Needless to say, I like a challenge and am up for any task
                that
                comes my way, design, web or otherwise!

                I thoroughly enjoy problem solving. Marrying this passion with my desire to be embedded in the world of
                visual communications and marketing is something I have loved developing both professionally and outside
                the
                9 – 5. My core values as a designer centre around uncovering creative solutions that best fit the needs
                of
                the task at hand, but with a fun and outside of the box approach.
                <br>
                <br>
                Aside from graphic design, my interests still largely lie within the creative realm. I enjoy sewing,
                painting (pictures, not houses), singing and playing piano. I do also enjoy getting out in nature in
                summer
                and going for a dip in the ocean.
