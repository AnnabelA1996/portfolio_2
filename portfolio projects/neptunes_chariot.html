    <h1 class="header">Neptunes Chariot</h1>

    <div class="center">
        <p class="blurb">
            As a part of my in agency experience at Harvey Cameron Design and Marketing Agency here in Christchurch, I
            was briefed to conceptualise a brand for a client who was opening a Greek market style restaurant. Elements
            outlined by the client such as, fusing high end dining with Greek market cuisine, creating and researching a
            story for the name of the restaurant, emblems consistent with Greek culture that can also be transferrable
            to the world of fine dining were what drew me to the final product… “Neptunes Chariot”
            <br><br>
            The overall logo is inspired by the iconic Louis Vuitton monogram that can be custom printed onto your
            luggage. To do this I used a serif typeface and monogrammed with the brand colours that would run throughout
            the restaurant. This element of the branding and logo is a nod to the high-end guideline within the brief.
            <br><br>
            Now tapping into Greek culture. Of course you must be thinking “But Annabel, Neptune is from Roman
            mythology!” we simply decided “Poseidon’s chariot” didn’t have the right ring to it, so Neptune was our next
            best option. I looked to mythological symbolism for this, where of course Neptune’s trident jumps into
            action. Fortunately for me, this acted not only as Greek symbolism but also tying this to food (which this
            branding project is ultimately about) because a trident also looks like a giant fork. I styled the trident
            to be cohesive with the monogram typeface by creating serif caps on it that aligned to the exact look of the
            font. I also incorporated a traditional Greek border straight from a frieze sculpture into the branding on
            products such as hard cover menus and takeaway packaging.
