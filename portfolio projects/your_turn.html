            For the Your Turn. branding I turned to traditional Maori and Pasifika emblems for inspiration including but
            not limited to imagery drawn from mythology, traditional carving and weaving patterns. We eventually decided
            it was important that the design spoke to something that is integral in both cultures and widely understood
            by other cultures; so I ran with a design heavily inspired by weaving for the social media profile photo.
            <br><br>
            As far as the typeface goes, the client had expressed they wanted it to have a handwritten quality verging
            on a brush stroke, so I used the font “Black Space” for this element of the design and other branding
            purposes.
            <br><br>
            The colour scheme was briefed to include a range of warm toned yellows and oranges to not only be eye
            catching but also align with the brands values of being a support network for Maori and Pasifika youth.

            “Your Turn. is a podcast (and eventually a TV series) that aims to become an enterprise where you Pasifika
            and Maori can get to know other mentors from similar backgrounds. As minorities, Pasifika and Maori youth
            still struggle in the modern world due to a lack of information, resources, and interest in change. This
            comes down to many reasons, one main factor being the devotion and tradition within our own families. This
            podcast will take a modern approach to having a healthier and more prosperous lifestyle, while putting our
            young people in touch with the opportunities and information that can help them do the same. We will explore
            these themes through the power of conversation with more experienced community members, all while staying
            true to the culture that makes us unique.”
